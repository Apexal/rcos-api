# Database Schema

[Schema Visualization](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5f6e22a87da1ea736e2f60af)

### Why is the SQL file not included?
Using a DBML file allows us to more easily make changes and keep our visualization up to date. The SQL can be generated from it at any time with the [dbml-cli](https://www.dbml.org/cli/#convert-a-dbml-file-to-sql).
